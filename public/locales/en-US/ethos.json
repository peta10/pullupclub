    "title": "The Legend of Alkeios",
    "quote1": "In the early days of Battle Bunker, there was a soldier named <1>Alkeios</1>. During a brutal mission deep behind enemy lines, his unit was trapped — 100 men and women, buried alive in a collapsed underground bunker. The only way out was vertical — a 60-foot shaft with no ladder, no ropes, and no exit plan.",
    "quote2": "One by one, Alkeios pulled them out with nothing but his bare hands and iron will — 100 rescues, each one costing him blood, pain, and breath. When the final soldier reached safety, Alkeios collapsed. His body was broken, but none were left behind.",
    "summary": "That act of endurance, sacrifice, and unbreakable resolve became known as the origin of the Pull-Up Club — where every pull-up is a nod to the warrior who lifted others from the pit when all hope was gone."
